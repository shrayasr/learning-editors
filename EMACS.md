## Points of interest

* `ctrl L` moves the cursor line to the middle of the screen, again moves it to the top and again to the bottom.
* `CTRL` characters are used to talk about the smallest block of operation (chars, lines, etc). The same keybindings used with `META` talk to blocks defined by the smaller `CTRL` based blocks. Eg: `ctrl a` moves to start of line, where `meta a` moves to the start of a sentence.
* Defaults are much more palitable
* Nice differences between killing and deleting text and how emacs understands when to do what
* Very context understanding. Nice how it remembers that successive `ctrl k`s is the same block and yanks all of them together

## Botherations
* Too much effort to type numeric arguments to commands `ctrl u 10 ctrl v`

## Questions
* What does the `a` in `ctrl a` mean? 
* Why suddenly to use `ctrl w` to delete a region?
